# We are given a list of (axis-aligned) rectangles. Each rectangle[i] = [xi1, yi1, xi2, yi2] , where (xi1, yi1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (xi2, yi2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the ith rectangle.

# Find the total area covered by all rectangles in the plane. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: rectangles = [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: As illustrated in the picture.
# Example 2:

# Input: rectangles = [[0,0,1000000000,1000000000]]
# Output: 49
# Explanation: The answer is 1018 modulo (109 + 7), which is (109)2 = (-7)2 = 49.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= rectangles.length <= 200
# rectanges[i].length = 4
# 0 <= rectangles[i][j] <= 109
# The total area covered by all rectangles will never exceed 263 - 1 and thus will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.


# This solution works:
